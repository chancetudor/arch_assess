# arch_assess
This is a script I wrote to deal with inputting data into a large Excel spreadsheet for my summer 2019 internship. I was tasked with assessing proposed apps' security architectures and rating them based on specific criteria. The script lists each section name and each subsections' details, and then asks the user to input a rating for that subsection.
